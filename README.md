We are two passionate book lovers with a dream: to open a charming bookstore just around the corner!  But the big questions are:
  
‚ú® Which books should we stock?  
‚ú® How many copies should we order?

To answer these critical questions, we leveraged data analytics, automation, and API integrations using:

- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

- Visualization libraries for insights

- NYT API for real-time bestseller tracking


### Technical Approach

#### Step 1: Data Cleaning & Wrangling (CSV)

Filtered book data based on:

‚≠ê Ratings ‚â• 4.5

üìù Review count ‚â• 4000

- Analyzed category distribution (10 main categories)

- Selected Top 20 books within each category

- Examined price distribution to optimize stocking decisions

#### Step 2: Automating Future Inventory Selection

- Bestseller List Automation: Automatically fetches top-trending books 

- NYT Book Reviews API: Retrieves critical reviews for marketing & in-depth insights 

#### Step 3: Final Stock List Generation

- Generated a structured CSV file for easy inventory management 

- Ready-to-use data for purchasing decisions & business strategy
